# Hello, World!

"Hello, World!" is a small piece of code used to illustrate basic syntax. These programs are often the first project completed when learning a new language. The code ensures software is correctly installed, compiles successfully, and the operator understands how to use it.

This is probably a good place to start. Although, the exclamation point is a little much.

Have told myself for years that I needed to write. But actually, I do it all the time. Mostly with a Sharpie on Post-it notes, in Markdown gathering digital dust, or as Discord messages scrolling into the ephemeral ether. Maybe it is not writing that is needed. Rather, organizing words in a location where they can be shared and archived.

When a tweet for the [Ethereum.org Writers Cohort](https://ethereumwriterscohort.carrd.co/) passed under my thumb it seemed like an opportunity. A chance to sharpen my skills and develop another habit fueled by whiskey and nicotine. A way to distribute my critical rambling and insightful stutters. A turn to finally document my experiences and beliefs. What it turned into is one more damn thing I gotta do.

So I did what any aging technologist would do and chose the most difficult path possible. Instead of picking from the array of options readily available for self-publishers I decided to roll my own. Why pick an easy-to-use tool whose experience has been optimized by well-funded designers and engineers when I can stay up late trying to figure how to install, configure, and deploy a sexy stack while pair programming with ChatGPT?

Failed to mention I am not a developer. Maybe once upon a time in a galaxy far far away but even that is hyperbole. I was one of those kids that grew up with a green screen and figured out HTML shortly after Tim Berners-Lee. But, "I have people skills. I am good at dealing with people. Can't you understand that?" And I digress. We can revisit the backstory leading up to this chaotic life in crypto at a later date if anyone gives a shit.

So here we are on this 17th day of May in the year of 2023. Not only did I spin up this site to publish the post, I also added a docs site to gather research, and a homepage to link to the subdomains. May even find a way use my [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/earth2travis.eth) to weave an extra layer into this loom of complexity.

Like Lennie I had the best intentions of shipping a banger to shock the Web3 ecosystem. But the alcohol is starting to work as I `command-v` into the word counter feeling like the annoying kid in the backseat on a road trip. Maybe I can install a VSCode extension to automate this process and improve my productivity. But that can wait as it is time to celebrate.

Let me take pleasure in pushing this to Github. Avoiding obstacles, excuses, and a debilitating drive to over-optimize. These words entered your eyeballs or ear holes because I took a bias towards publishing. It can only get better from here.
